    <h1>System Administration Project</h1>

    <h2>Project Summary</h2>
<p>The goal of this project was to set up servers with virtual machines and use active directory to control users and computers and implement certain specifications that the company required. By using tools like group policy we implemented the restrictions and conditions that the company required. I worked with 2 other members of my class to build this project.</p>
<h2>Skills Learned</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Collaborating with a team</li>
        <li>Group Policy</li>
        <li>DFS</li>
        <li>Active Directory</li>
        <li>HyperV</li>
    </ul>
    
<h2>Challenges</h2>
    <p>With group policy being such a large subject and having many options of effects to implement my group had some issues finding our way around how it worked. We overcame this challenge by searching online for people who had similar problems and using a book on group policy to understand what we were doing and what policies effected certain things.</p>
