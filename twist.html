    <h1>TWIST</h1>

    <h2>Project Summary</h2>
<p>The Main learning objectives for this project were to collaborate with a team to create an application for use in the TWIST program and also to learn how web technologies such as GitHub, Turbo360 and methods of programming fit together to create a product.

In this project I contributed mostly through designing the layout of the site and implementing CRUD.

While this may not be my best work this was a great learning experience for working with a team and learning how to manage time effectively. This project taught me that you can learn more when the project isn't going as planned rather than when everything is running smoothly.

<h2>Skills Learned</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Time Management</li>
        <li>Communication</li>
        <li>Using web technologies to create applications</li>
    </ul>
    
<h2>Challenges</h2>
    <p>
    My group had a few challenges with this project. The first issue was communication. We needed to better relay information to group members. We worked through this by reviewing changes with each other. Another challenge was learning how to use mustache. I hadn't previously used it in other projects and needed to learn it for this one. I looked up some guides on how it worked and got through this issue quickly. The last issue was concerning time management. We learned that we needed to set specific short term goals that would work to accomplish the end goal.
