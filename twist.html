    <h1>TWIST</h1>

    <h2>Project Summary</h2>
<p>The Main learning objectives for this project were to collaborate with a team to create an application for use in the TWIST program and also to learn how web technologies such as GitHub, Turbo360 and methods of programming fit together to create a product.

In this project I contributed mostly through designing the layout of the site and implementing CRUD.

This was a great learning experience for working with a team.

<h2>Challenges</h2>
    <p>
    My group had a few challenges with this project. The first issue was communication. We needed to better relay information to group members. We worked through this by reviewing changes with each other. Another challenge was learning how to use mustache. I hadn't previously used it in other projects and needed to learn it for this one. I looked up some guides on how it worked and got through this issue quickly.
