    <h1>Rebecca Morrison House Web Project</h1>

    <h2>Project Summary</h2>
    <p>This goal of this project was to create a web application for the Rebecca Morrison House for use in their facilities to keep track of guests, rooms, donations and improve all aspects of their record keeping. </p>
    
<h2>Skills Learned</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Working effectively with a team</li>
        <li>Using web technologies such as Handlebars to implement design and layout changes</li>
        <li>Communicating with a Client</li>
        
    </ul>
    
<h2>Challenges</h2>
    <p>One of my biggest challenges was understanding the backend team's programming and using what they built to create a style and layout that worked with their work so that when new data was entered, the layout would automatically update to fit with the new data. Another challenge was with time management. This was overcome easily because I had set objectives for what I was going to get done each day I came into class and that kept me on track. An additonal challenge was learning how to work with a client and getting the information that you need from them to build the product into what they are wanting.</p>
