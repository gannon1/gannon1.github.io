    <h2>Project Summary</h2>
    <p>The goal of this paper was to find a problem in the world that has no obvious solution and research ways to make the issue less significant.</p>
    
<h2>Skills Learned</h2>
    <ul>
        <li></li>
    </ul>
        
<h2>Challenges</h2>
    <p>Research for my topic was my biggest challenge with this paper. A lot of the sources I found were simply analyses of school shootings rather than potential solutions to the problem. Because of that I had to broaden the area that I was searching in and look for sources that weren't specifically about school shootings.</p>
